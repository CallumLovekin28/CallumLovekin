## Info

**Name:** Callum Lovekin

**Student Number:** 96454216

**Course:** WEB14104

### Introduction

Over the course of these projects i have learned not only alot about design but also myself and what I wish to persue in the next 2 years of the course. The last couple months have been a great taster of things to come over the rest of the course and I have really enjoyed what I have learned.

### Eye Bombing :eyes: :bomb:

This was an interesting project and was a great introduction to a different way of seeing things and helping me have a different design eye in my every day life!

### Union Hack :gb: :crossed_flags:

I really enjoyed looking at flags and just how complex they are, the thought that goes behind creating a flag is incredible and this project really helped me see flags differently and helped me with how I design!

### One Tweet :point_up::bird:

Using only a limted amount of text was a struggle but really pushed my creative mind. Having to create a typography poster with a limted amount of content was a struggle but excercised the creative part of my brain.

### Code On Your Plate :fork_and_knife: :page_facing_up:

I previously already had knowledge of html and css and this project was by far my favourite one of them all. I learned some new pieces of CSS that I did not know and had a lot of fun using them.

### CSS Tricks :page_facing_up: :computer:

I love playing with CSS and this project was so much fun for me! I had to research Animate.css and create a demo showing off what it can do and it was my favourite project, so much that it is what I produced my summative on!
