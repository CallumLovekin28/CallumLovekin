### Story

The story that I want my page to tell is about Mental Health. I want my page to inform people about the invisible illnesses that people have and the rising level of mental health in young people. I want to be able to create a one page informative site which is interactive and gets the message across about mental health. I will also be including a small story about my own experience and what I have been going through.

### Visualise Information
Using extracts from sites, dictionaries and have a brain that shows you where certain illnesses form and are in the brain. Interactive brain scans of people with mental illness and people without.

My journey with mental health is still an ongoing one, and finding techniques and routines that can help me feel mentally more healthy is something I look at everyday. I have Derealization and essentially what that means is nothing feels real to me.

What? What do you mean nothing feels real? Explain it?

I get that question every time someone asks me and there isnt really a way I can describe what it feels like... Well atleast in a way where people will understand.
