### Story

The story that I want my page to tell is about Mental Health. I want my page to inform people about the invisible illnesses that people have and the rising level of mental health in young people. I want to be able to create a one page informative site which is interactive and gets the message across about mental health. I will also be including a small story about my own experience and what I have been going through.

### Visualise Information
Using extracts from sites, dictionaries and have a brain that shows you where certain illnesses form and are in the brain. Interactive brain scans of people with mental illness and people without.

# My Story :video_camera: :books:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijhL3iS38a4




My journey with mental health is still an ongoing one, and finding techniques and routines that can help me feel mentally more healthy is something I look at everyday. I have Derealization and essentially what that means is nothing feels real to me.

What? What do you mean nothing feels real? Explain it?

I get that question every time someone asks me and there isnt really a way I can describe what it feels like... Well atleast in a way where people will understand.


# Work So Far
